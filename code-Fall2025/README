Installing packages in julia:

    1. Press ] key to get into package mode.
    2. Type "add NAMEOFPACKAGE"
    3. "status: shows all teh added packages
    4. DELETE gets you out of package mode

Running shell commands in julia
   julia> run(`ls`)


1. NestedBinaryFinal_Fast.jl
The top-level function is Master.  It takes in input file (example sample.txt)
  m_1, m_2, M_donor
  a_in, e_in, a_out, e_out, theta, i
  t_tot (in units of inner binary period), timestep setting, stability percentage (e.g. 5=5%)

Determines whether or not this system is stable.

TO RUN IT
        > julia
   julia> include("NestedBinaryFinal_Fast.jl")
   julia> Master('sample.txt')

2. NestedBinaryFinal_Write.jl
Same as NestedBinaryFinal_Fast.jl but writes info about every timestep????  Currently does not run

3. AutomaticTester.jl

The top-level function is StabilityFinder. It takes in the masses and
the inner binary separation of a desired nested binary configuration
and returns the smallest such outer binary separation such that the
system remains stable over the desired time period. This time period
is defaulted to 100P of the inner binary. This can easily be adjusted
by changing this value in the `AutomaticTester.jl` file and reloading
the file. This program will also stores the stable separation in
`StabilityConditions.xlsx`.

To run, for example: 

   julia> StabilityFinder([8,8,1],7.2,0,5)


4. AutoLooper.jl

Finds the smallest stable outer binary separation for the triple
with specified masses for a range of inner binary separations
between a1 and a1_fin.  The results are stored in `StabilityConditions.xlsx`.

To run, for example: 
    julia> Looper([1.5, 1.5, 1], 2, 40)
